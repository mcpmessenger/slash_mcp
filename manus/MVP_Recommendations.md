# MVP Recommendations for Slash / MCP

## 1. Summary of Findings

### Browser Extension Blocking Issue:

As noted in the PM's original message, the application experienced `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` errors when running locally on `http://localhost:5173`. This was confirmed by observing a blank page and console errors. The issue was resolved by running the frontend on port `3000` (`http://localhost:3000`), which is often whitelisted by browser extensions. Additionally, deploying a static preview to a public URL (`https://pehljqmf.manus.space/`) also bypassed this issue, confirming it was client-side and related to browser extension blocking.

### Application Functionality Analysis:

The Slash / MCP application is a prototype demonstrating the Model Context Protocol. It features a React frontend and a Node/WebSocket backend. Key functionalities observed include:

*   **Connection Management:** The application requires two connections to start. It defaults to `ws://localhost:8080`.
*   **Terminal Interface:** A terminal-like interface is available for interacting with the backend.
*   **Sidebar:** The sidebar manages connections, resources, tools, and prompts.
*   **Resource Upload (Mock):** The application supports mock resource uploads.
*   **Tool Invocation:** It can invoke tools, including `shell_execute` with a whitelisted set of commands.
*   **UI/UX:** The UI includes dark/light mode, a terminal modal, multi-client manager, and a resizable sidebar.

## 2. MVP Functionality Recommendations

Based on the current state and the README's roadmap, here are recommendations for MVP functionality:

### Core Functionality:

*   **Robust Connection Handling:** Implement clear visual feedback for connection status (connected, disconnected, error). Auto-reconnect functionality for dropped connections.
*   **Basic Command Execution:** Ensure the `shell_execute` tool is fully functional with the whitelisted commands. Provide clear error messages for disallowed commands.
*   **Real-time Output Streaming:** Prioritize real-time `stdout` streaming via incremental JSON-RPC notifications as mentioned in the roadmap. This is crucial for a responsive terminal experience.
*   **Resource Persistence:** Implement the persistence and serving of uploaded resources. This is a fundamental requirement for any practical application involving file uploads.

### Key Integrations:

*   **Supabase Integration:** Fully integrate Supabase for persistent storage of resources and potentially user data. This aligns with the existing `env.example` and `README.md` mentions.
*   **Basic LLM Integration:** Implement a basic LLM integration (e.g., `mcp_invokeTool â†’ llm_chat`) to demonstrate the core value proposition of the Model Context Protocol. This could be a simple text-in, text-out interaction.

## 3. GUI Recommendations

### User Onboarding & Guidance:

*   **Initial Setup Walkthrough:** Provide a clear, concise in-app walkthrough for new users, especially regarding the 


initial connection setup and how to use the terminal.
*   **Improved Error Messaging:** Enhance error messages, especially for connection issues and command execution failures, to be more user-friendly and actionable.

### Usability & Responsiveness:

*   **Intuitive Connection Management:** Make the process of adding and managing connections more intuitive. Consider visual cues for active/inactive connections.
*   **Responsive Layout:** Ensure the application is fully responsive across different screen sizes and devices. While the current layout is somewhat responsive, further optimization for mobile and tablet views would be beneficial.
*   **Visual Feedback for Actions:** Provide clear visual feedback for user actions, such as button clicks, file uploads, and command execution status.

### Enhancements:

*   **Theming Options:** While dark/light mode is present, consider expanding with more theming options or customization for a more personalized user experience.
*   **Notification System:** Implement a subtle notification system for important events, such as successful connections, disconnections, or long-running command completions.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Visuals:** Enhance the visual feedback for drag-and-drop functionality, especially for resource uploads, to make it more apparent where items can be dropped and what the status of the upload is.

## 4. Next Steps

1.  **Prioritize and Implement Core Functionality:** Focus on getting robust connection handling, basic command execution, real-time output streaming, and resource persistence fully functional.
2.  **Integrate Supabase:** Set up and integrate Supabase for persistent storage.
3.  **Implement Basic LLM Integration:** Develop a minimal LLM integration to showcase the core MCP concept.
4.  **Refine GUI based on MVP Functionality:** Iterate on the GUI, focusing on user onboarding, improved error messaging, and overall usability.
5.  **User Testing:** Conduct early user testing with the MVP to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.
6.  **Documentation:** Update the `README.md` with clear instructions for running the application, especially regarding the port issue, and document the new MVP functionalities.
