# AI-to-AI Communication Architecture with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## 1. Introduction

This section outlines a proposed architecture for enabling AI-to-AI communication using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), leveraging the `slash_mcp` client and a custom backend server. The goal is to demonstrate how different AI models, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and GitHub Copilot, can interact and exchange information through a standardized protocol.

## 2. Core Components

To facilitate AI-to-AI communication, the following core components are essential:

### 2.1. `slash_mcp` Frontend Client

The `slash_mcp` application serves as the user interface and a client for the MCP. It initiates communication with the backend server via WebSockets and sends JSON-RPC 2.0 messages. It will be extended to display and manage interactions between multiple AI agents, specifically incorporating **side-by-side terminals** for real-time monitoring of MCP communication between two AIs.

### 2.2. MCP Backend Server

This custom backend server is the central hub for all MCP communication. It acts as an intermediary between the `slash_mcp` client and various AI models. Its responsibilities include:

*   **WebSocket Endpoint:** Exposing a WebSocket endpoint to receive JSON-RPC 2.0 messages from the `slash_mcp` client.
*   **MCP Message Routing:** Parsing incoming MCP messages and routing them to the appropriate AI model or service.
*   **AI Model Integration:** Containing adapters or connectors for different AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Copilot) to translate MCP requests into model-specific API calls and vice-versa.
*   **Resource Management:** Storing and managing resources (text, images, etc.) exchanged between AI models.
*   **Tool Invocation:** Handling `mcp_invokeTool` requests by executing predefined tools or forwarding them to specific AI models capable of tool use.
*   **State Management:** Maintaining the state of ongoing AI-to-AI conversations and interactions.

### 2.3. AI Model Adapters/Connectors

Each AI model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Copilot) will require a dedicated adapter or connector within the MCP Backend Server. These adapters will be responsible for:

*   **Request Translation:** Converting incoming MCP requests (e.g., `mcp_sendResource`, `mcp_invokeTool`) into the native API calls understood by the respective AI model.
*   **Response Translation:** Converting responses from the AI models back into MCP-compatible JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Managing API keys and authentication tokens for secure access to each AI model.
*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handling errors and exceptions from AI model APIs.

## 3. AI-to-AI Communication Flow

The following steps illustrate a typical AI-to-AI communication flow using MCP:

1.  **Initiation:** A user (via `slash_mcp` client) or an automated process initiates a conversation or task that requires interaction between two AI models. This could involve sending an initial prompt or resource to a primary AI agent.

2.  **Primary AI Processing:** The primary AI agent (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4) receives the input via its adapter in the MCP Backend Server. It processes the request and determines if it needs assistance from another AI model or an external tool.

3.  **MCP Request Generation:** If the primary AI needs to interact with another AI, it generates an MCP request (e.g., `mcp_invokeTool` to a secondary AI or `mcp_sendResource` to share context). This request is sent back to the MCP Backend Server through its adapter.

4.  **Backend Routing:** The MCP Backend Server receives the MCP request from the primary AI's adapter. Based on the `method` and `params` in the JSON-RPC 2.0 message, it identifies the target AI model or tool.

5.  **Secondary AI Interaction:** The MCP Backend Server routes the request to the appropriate adapter for the secondary AI model (e.g., Anthropic's Claude). The adapter translates the MCP request into the secondary AI's native API call.

6.  **Secondary AI Processing:** The secondary AI processes the request and generates a response. This response is sent back to its adapter in the MCP Backend Server.

7.  **MCP Response Generation:** The secondary AI's adapter translates the response back into an MCP-compatible JSON-RPC 2.0 message.

8.  **Backend Routing (Response):** The MCP Backend Server receives the MCP response from the secondary AI's adapter and routes it back to the primary AI's adapter.

9.  **Primary AI Continues:** The primary AI receives the response from the secondary AI and continues its processing, potentially generating a final response to the user or initiating further AI-to-AI interactions.

10. **Final Output:** The final output from the primary AI is sent back to the `slash_mcp` client for display to the user.

## 4. MCP Compatibility with AI Models

Based on recent information, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is gaining traction as an open standard for AI agents. Here's a summary of its compatibility with the mentioned AI models:

*   **Anthropic:** Anthropic is the creator and primary proponent of MCP [1]. Their models, such as Claude, are designed to work seamlessly with the protocol.
*   **OpenAI:** While OpenAI does not natively implement MCP, the protocol is designed to be compatible with most LLM APIs, including OpenAI's [2]. This means that an adapter can translate MCP messages to OpenAI's API format and vice-versa.
*   **Gemini (Google):** Similar to OpenAI, Gemini models can be integrated with MCP through an adapter. The MCP website explicitly mentions built-in support for Gemini [2]. Google is also working on A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol which complements MCP [3].
*   **GitHub Copilot:** GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer, can also be integrated with MCP. There are examples and discussions about boosting Copilot's intelligence using MCP [4].

In essence, while Anthropic models have native support, other major LLMs like OpenAI, Gemini, and Copilot can be made MCP-compatible through the use of adapters within the backend server. This allows for a flexible and interoperable ecosystem of AI agents.

## 5. Development Steps for a Working Project

To build a working project that demonstrates AI-to-AI communication using MCP, the following development steps are recommended:

### 5.1. Phase 1: Basic MCP Backend Server with Single AI Integration

1.  **Choose a Backend Technology:** Select a programming language and framework for your MCP Backend Server. Node.js with `ws` (WebSocket) library or Python with `FastAPI` and `websockets` are good choices due to their strong support for WebSockets and asynchronous operations.

2.  **Set up WebSocket Server:** Implement a basic WebSocket server that listens for incoming connections from the `slash_mcp` frontend.

3.  **Implement JSON-RPC 2.0 Parsing:** Develop logic to parse incoming WebSocket messages as JSON-RPC 2.0 requests. This involves extracting the `method`, `params`, and `id` from the request.

4.  **Integrate First AI Model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4):**
    *   **Create an OpenAI Adapter:** Develop a module within your backend server that handles communication with the OpenAI API. This adapter will:
        *   Take an MCP request (e.g., `mcp_invokeTool` for a chat completion).
        *   Translate it into an OpenAI API call (e.g., `openai.chat.completions.create`).
        *   Send the request to OpenAI.
        *   Receive the response from OpenAI.
        *   Translate the OpenAI response back into an MCP-compatible JSON-RPC 2.0 response.
    *   **Handle `mcp_invokeTool` for Chat:** Implement the `mcp_invokeTool` method on your backend to specifically handle requests for chat completions. When this method is called, it should use the OpenAI adapter to interact with the OpenAI API.

5.  **Implement `mcp_sendResource`:** Develop the `mcp_sendResource` method to receive and store resources (e.g., text, code snippets) sent from the `slash_mcp` client. For initial testing, simply logging the received resource or storing it in memory is sufficient.

6.  **Connect `slash_mcp` Frontend:** Configure your `slash_mcp` frontend to connect to your locally running MCP Backend Server (e.g., `ws://localhost:8080`). Test sending basic commands from the `slash_mcp` terminal to your backend and verify that the OpenAI adapter processes them.

### 5.2. Phase 2: Multi-AI Integration and Basic AI-to-AI Communication

1.  **Integrate Second AI Model (e.g., Anthropic Claude):**
    *   **Create an Anthropic Adapter:** Similar to the OpenAI adapter, develop a module for Anthropic Claude. This adapter will translate MCP requests to Anthropic API calls and vice-versa.
    *   **Extend `mcp_invokeTool` for Multi-AI:** Modify your `mcp_invokeTool` implementation to be able to route requests to either OpenAI or Anthropic based on the `tool_name` or other parameters in the MCP request. For example, `mcp_invokeTool(connectionId, 'openai_chat', { prompt: '...' })` or `mcp_invokeTool(connectionId, 'anthropic_chat', { prompt: '...' })`.

2.  **Implement Basic AI-to-AI Orchestration:**
    *   **Backend Logic for AI-to-AI:** Introduce logic within your MCP Backend Server that allows one AI to trigger another. This could be as simple as:
        *   AI_A receives a prompt.
        *   AI_A determines it needs information from AI_B.
        *   AI_A sends an `mcp_invokeTool` request targeting AI_B through the backend.
        *   The backend routes this request to AI_B.
        *   AI_B processes the request and sends a response back to the backend.
        *   The backend routes AI_B's response back to AI_A.
        *   AI_A uses AI_B's response to formulate its own final response.
    *   **Example Scenario:** A simple scenario could be: User asks AI_A a question. AI_A, if it doesn't know the answer, asks AI_B (a specialized AI for that topic) for help. AI_B provides the answer, which AI_A then relays to the user.
### 5.3. Phase 3: Advanced Features and Additional AI Integrations

1.  **Integrate Gemini and GitHub Copilot:** Repeat the adapter creation process for Gemini and GitHub Copilot, allowing your backend to communicate with these models.

2.  **Implement `mcp_clarification` and `mcp_elicitation`:** Based on the `mcp_clarification.md` and `slash_mcp_prd.md` documents, implement these methods to handle scenarios where the AI needs more information from the user or another AI.

3.  **Resource Sharing and Context Management:** Enhance the `mcp_sendResource` implementation to allow for more sophisticated resource management, including persistent storage and sharing of context between different AI models during a multi-turn conversation.

4.  **Tool Definition and Discovery:** Implement a mechanism for AI models to define and discover available tools. This could involve the backend maintaining a registry of tools and their capabilities, which AI models can query.

5.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling and comprehensive logging within the backend server to monitor AI-to-AI interactions and debug issues.
