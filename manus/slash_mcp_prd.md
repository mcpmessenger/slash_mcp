# Product Requirements Document: Slash / MCP

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the features, functionalities, and technical specifications for the Slash / MCP project. The primary goal of this project is to develop a systems-agnostic application that adheres to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and provides a seamless user experience with both light and dark mode interfaces. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development team, ensuring a shared understanding of the product vision and requirements.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of Slash / MCP is to provide a robust and flexible platform for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and external data sources/tools, leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It aims to standardize how applications provide context to LLMs, enabling seamless integration and collaborative AI agent workflows. The application will support various data types as resources, facilitate structured prompts, enable tool invocation, and manage recursive LLM interactions through sampling. A key aspect is the ability to handle visual data, such as screenshots, as viable resources for enhanced context.

## 3. Scope

The scope of this project includes the development of a systems-agnostic application that implements the core functionalities of the MCP. This encompasses:

*   **Core MCP Communication:** Implementation of JSON-RPC 2.0 messaging for host-server communication.
*   **Resource Management:** Handling of diverse data types (textual, structured, binary including images/screenshots) as MCP resources.
*   **Prompting System:** Support for templated messages and workflows for guiding LLM behavior.
*   **Tool Invocation:** Mechanism for LLMs to expose and invoke functions or capabilities.
*   **Sampling:** Support for server-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions.
*   **User Interface (UI):** Development of a responsive and intuitive user interface with distinct light and dark mode themes.
*   **Branding:** Integration of Slash / MCP branding elements.
*   **Developer Information:** Inclusion of developer branding for automationalien.com.

This PRD does not cover the development of the underlying LLMs or external services that will interact with Slash / MCP, but rather focuses on the client application that facilitates these interactions.

## 4. Features

### 4.1. Core MCP Functionality

*   **Resource Exchange:** Ability to send and receive various data types as resources, including but not limited to text, JSON, and binary data (e.g., images, screenshots).
*   **Prompt Management:** Users can define and utilize templated prompts to interact with LLMs.
*   **Tool Integration:** Seamless invocation and execution of tools exposed by LLMs or external services.
*   **Recursive Interaction Support:** Facilitation of multi-step, recursive LLM interactions through the sampling mechanism.
*   **Root Management:** Define and manage filesystem or URI boundaries for MCP server operations.
*   **Elicitation:** Support for server-initiated requests for additional information from users.

### 4.2. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

#### 4.2.1. General UI/UX Principles

*   **Systems Agnostic:** The application should be designed to run on various operating systems and environments without specific dependencies.
*   **Responsive Design:** The UI must be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Clear and easy-to-understand navigation for all functionalities.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms:** Provide clear visual and textual feedback for user actions and system status.
*   **Accessibility:** Adherence to accessibility best practices to ensure usability for all users.

#### 4.2.2. Light Mode Styling

*   **Color Palette:** A clean and professional color scheme with light backgrounds and contrasting dark text.
*   **Typography:** Legible fonts with appropriate sizing and line spacing.
*   **Component Styling:** Standard UI components (buttons, input fields, windows) with clear visual hierarchy.

#### 4.2.3. Dark Mode Styling

*   **Color Palette:** Inspired by 


obsidian, the dark mode styling will feature a predominantly black background with high-contrast text and elements. Buttons and windows will have a subtle 'back glow' effect to enhance their visibility and responsiveness. This glow should be a soft, diffused light that emanates from behind the elements, providing a modern and sophisticated aesthetic. The glow color should complement the black background, perhaps a subtle blue or purple, to avoid harshness.
*   **Typography:** Maintain legibility with appropriate font colors that stand out against the dark background.
*   **Component Styling:** All interactive elements, such as buttons, input fields, and windows, will be designed to be responsive and visually distinct in dark mode, incorporating the 'back glow' effect.

### 4.3. Branding

*   **Project Branding:** The application will prominently feature the 'Slash / MCP' branding. This includes the logo, name, and any associated visual elements.
*   **Developer Branding:** The developer, automationalien.com, will be credited appropriately within the application, likely in an 'About' section or footer.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1. Systems Agnostic Architecture

The application will be developed using technologies and frameworks that ensure its compatibility across various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and environments. This implies a focus on cross-platform compatibility and minimal system-specific dependencies.

### 5.2. MCP Protocol Implementation

*   **JSON-RPC 2.0:** Adherence to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification for all communication between the client application and MCP servers.
*   **Data Serialization:** Efficient and reliable serialization/deserialization of diverse data types (text, JSON, binary) for resource exchange.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms for MCP communication, including clear error messages and recovery strategies.

### 5.3. UI/UX Implementation

*   **Frontend Framework:** Selection of a frontend framework that supports responsive design, theming (light/dark mode), and efficient UI rendering (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
*   **Styling:** Use of CSS-in-JS, CSS modules, or a preprocessor (e.g., Sass, Less) to manage styles, particularly for theming and the 'back glow' effect.
*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensure consistent behavior and appearance across major web browsers.

## 6. Security Considerations

*   **Data Privacy:** Implement measures to protect user data and sensitive information exchanged as MCP resources. This includes encryption of data in transit and at rest where applicable.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** If user accounts or access to restricted resources are introduced in future iterations, robust authentication and authorization mechanisms will be required.
*   **Input Validation:** Strict validation of all user inputs and incoming MCP messages to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
*   **Consent for Screenshots:** If screenshots are captured directly by the application, clear user consent mechanisms must be in place, along with options for anonymization or redaction of sensitive information.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   **Multi-Client, Single-Server Architecture:** The current design supports a single client interacting with an MCP server. Future iterations may explore a multi-client, single-server architecture for collaborative AI agents, as discussed in the clarification document [1]. This would involve the central MCP server mediating inter-client communication and managing shared resources and toolsets.
*   **Advanced UI Features:** Implementation of more advanced UI components and interactions, such as drag-and-drop for resources, real-time collaboration features, or integrated development environment (IDE) like functionalities.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Continuous optimization of application performance, especially for handling large binary resources or complex recursive LLM interactions.
