## 1. Project Overview

The `slash_mcp` project currently serves as a full-stack prototype implementing the Model Context Protocol, featuring a React frontend and Node.js WebSocket backend. The existing system handles basic MCP operations including `mcp_sendResource`, `mcp_invokeTool` (specifically `shell_execute`), and `mcp_getCapabilities`. The communication layer utilizes JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSockets, providing a robust foundation for real-time interaction between AI agents and the backend services.

The proposed upgrade introduces a comprehensive suite of integrations that will transform the project from a basic shell execution environment into a powerful AI agent orchestration platform. Each integration has been carefully designed to expose specific functionalities through the MCP protocol, ensuring consistent interfaces and seamless interoperability.

### 1.1 Current System Capabilities

The existing `slash_mcp` system provides several foundational capabilities that will be preserved and enhanced during the upgrade. The React frontend offers an animated dark/light UI with terminal modals, multi-client management, and a resource sidebar. The backend implements a WebSocket server that handles JSON-RPC 2.0 communication, maintains client connections, and provides basic shell execution capabilities through a whitelisted command system.

The current architecture demonstrates several strengths that make it an ideal foundation for the proposed integrations. The modular design allows for easy extension of capabilities, the WebSocket-based communication provides real-time responsiveness, and the existing security model with command whitelisting establishes a pattern for secure integration development.

### 1.2 Integration Scope and Objectives

The seven planned integrations represent a strategic selection of services that address the most common needs of AI agents in modern workflows. Zapier integration enables connection to over 5,000 applications through workflow automation. Google Suite integration provides access to essential productivity tools including Drive, Docs, and Sheets. Supabase integration offers database operations and authentication services. Notion integration enables workspace management and knowledge base operations. Slack integration facilitates team communication and bot interactions. OpenAI integration provides access to advanced language models and AI services. GitHub integration enables repository management and development workflow automation.

Each integration is designed to expose multiple operations through a consistent MCP tool interface, allowing AI agents to perform complex multi-step workflows across different services. The integration architecture ensures that new services can be added in the future without disrupting existing functionality.

## 2. Architecture Analysis

### 2.1 Current Architecture Assessment

The existing `slash_mcp` architecture follows a clean separation of concerns with distinct frontend and backend layers. The React frontend manages user interface interactions and WebSocket client connections, while the Node.js backend handles protocol implementation and tool execution. This separation provides several advantages for the integration upgrade, including the ability to add new backend capabilities without requiring frontend changes and the flexibility to scale backend services independently.

The WebSocket communication layer implements JSON-RPC 2.0, which provides a standardized protocol for remote procedure calls. This choice proves particularly beneficial for the integration upgrade, as it allows for consistent method invocation patterns across all integrations. The existing message routing and client management systems can be extended to handle the increased complexity of multiple concurrent tool invocations.

The current tool execution model uses a registry pattern for managing available tools, which aligns perfectly with the proposed integration architecture. The existing `shell_execute` tool demonstrates the pattern that will be followed for all new integrations: tool registration, parameter validation, execution, and response formatting.

### 2.2 Proposed Integration Architecture

The integration architecture introduces a new layer of abstraction through the `ToolRegistry` class, which manages all available integrations and provides a unified interface for tool discovery and invocation. Each integration is implemented as a separate class that follows a consistent interface pattern, ensuring maintainability and testability.

The architecture diagram provided in the requirements illustrates the flow of communication from frontend clients through the WebSocket server to the tool adapters and finally to the external services. This flow will be implemented through a series of well-defined interfaces and protocols that ensure reliable communication and error handling.

The tool adapter layer serves as the primary integration point, translating MCP tool invocations into appropriate API calls for each external service. This layer handles authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and response formatting, providing a consistent experience for AI agents regardless of the underlying service complexity.

### 2.3 Data Flow and Communication Patterns

The data flow for the upgraded system follows a request-response pattern with support for streaming responses where appropriate. When an AI agent invokes a tool, the request flows from the frontend through the WebSocket connection to the backend, where it is routed to the appropriate tool adapter. The adapter performs the necessary operations with the external service and returns the results through the same path.

Error handling is implemented at multiple levels to ensure robust operation. The WebSocket layer handles connection errors and protocol violations. The tool registry handles tool discovery and invocation errors. Individual tool adapters handle service-specific errors and rate limiting. This multi-layered approach ensures that failures in one integration do not affect the operation of others.

The communication patterns support both synchronous and asynchronous operations, allowing for long-running tasks to be handled appropriately. The existing streaming capabilities can be extended to support real-time updates from external services where available.

## 3. Development Environment Setup
